# Music Player
 
## Week 1
At first I used flask to make the Music Player. It made the basic look of the Music Plasyer and made the virtual environment so that the application will not be reliant on adding the modules your self as it will already be a part of the application.
As python does not update dynamically with the flask application, I switched to Tkinter module and with the Pygame music mixer.

## Week 2
I made the tkinter application and had the basic play functionality. I originally used a linked list to play the music. The linked list could not loop the music when it ended and I could not figure out how to go to the previous song.

## Week 3
On this week I added multiple folders with different music so that you can have different albums of music. I also started to make the shuffler.

## Week 4
On this week I made the searching window. This used linear search and recursion to find the desired result.
